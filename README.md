## How it works

- Data is stored in the URL only (no database) except for the encryption key if you decide to use it
- You can share the URL with people

## How to run

You can self-host using `python -m http.server` or just open the file directly (untested)

## Using AI

Most of this was written by AI, either OpenAI (o1 & o3-mini-high), Deepseek (R1), or Gemini (2.0 Pro Experimental 02-05).

AI has been good for things like calculating the layouts and initial build, but it has not been so good at complex UI interactions.

It would be interesting to see if more bug fixes/features can be done simply with prompting the AI and giving it the code.
